# kinect-the-blind

This is the repository for kinect-the-blind.

To use this repository, you must be running on Windows 10 and be using a USB 3.0 cable to connect a Kinect 2.

After cloning to your desktop, run "npm install" in the root folder to update modules. Right now, our working folder is Navigation. cd into it and then run "node index.js"

Ensure that you already connected the Kinect 2 and the arduino. The arduino should have a jumper wire on pin 10 connecting to the motor and the other pin to ground.

The kinect should be able to detect any object blocking its view within 50 cm.
